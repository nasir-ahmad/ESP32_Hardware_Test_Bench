# ESP32 MCPWM Module Basics

This repository provides an introduction to using the MCPWM (Motor Control Pulse Width Modulation) module of the ESP32. The MCPWM module is a powerful hardware feature designed for precise motor control and general-purpose PWM signal generation. This repository includes examples and instructions to configure the MCPWM module for various applications, such as generating custom PWM waveforms.


## Features:
- Generate PWM signals with customizable frequency, duty cycle, and resolution.
- Support for complementary signals with adjustable dead time.
- Fine-grained control of MCPWM timers and operator units.
- Applications include motor control, signal generation, and pulse-width modulation.
